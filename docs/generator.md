# Chemical Generator


## Usage üöÄ

The basic version of this chemical generator is implemented in the script `generator.py`. You can execute it using the following command:

```sh
python3 generator.py <input-filename>.txt [-debug] [-o <output-filename>.txt]
```

where:
- **-debug** enables debug info printing
- **-o <filename>** enables the choice of output file name

## Dev Notes üõ†Ô∏è

The generator is composed of a class `ReactionGenerator`, that has a constructor that saves the data parsed by the GeneratorIO class. It also has a `run_generation` method that executes all the step in order to obtain the generated reactions and the new species.

Let's see in detail how it works!

First of all, it generates the catalyzers following these steps:
- In order for a specie to be a catalyzers it needs to be in the length range defined in the input file
- It first chooses the catalyzers for condensation:
    1. If there are enough catalyzer species for each class of reaction, every class of reaction will happen. For each reaction a catalyzer specie is extracted randomly to be the chosen catalyzer for that reaction, and is removed from the pool of extractable catalyzer species.
    2. otherwise **n** class of reactions will be randomly chosen to happen (where **n** is the number of species that serve as catalyzers), then the same happens for this case, so for each chosen reaction, a catalyzer specie will be assigned.
    3. After choosing the initial catalyzers, if those are less than the required number of catalyzers specified in the input file (second and third line in catalyzers section), other species will be randomly assigned to the reaction classes, until we meet the requirements.
- After choosing the catalyzers for condensation, we have two branches depending on the **both_on** parameter:
    1. If it is **ON**, we choose the catalyzers for cleavage reaction classes, with the same process and the **same species pool**
    2. If it is **OFF**, we choose the catalyzers for cleavage reaction classes, with the same process, but with a **species pool that doesn't contain the condensation catalyzers**.

After generating the catalyzers, it generates all the possible condensation and cleavage reactions and it eliminates the duplicate reactions. In order to delete the dup reactions it follows this general rule:
- Two reactions are **doubles** if they have the same reactant and the same product, excluding the catalyzer, without caring about the order.

Finally it executes the `generate_new_species` method, that follows these steps:
- It extends the existing species with all the products of condensation and cleavage reactions 
- It calls the `generate_new_catalyzers`, that:
    1. For each species in the list, a species is randomly selected.
    2. The length of this species determines its class, and based on this class, the probabilities of it becoming a condensation catalyzer or a cleavage catalyzer are evaluated. Specifically, a random chance is compared against the predefined probabilities for each class to decide whether the species becomes a condensation catalyzer or a cleavage catalyzer.
    3. If a species can become both cond and cll catalyzer, but the parameter both_on in catalyzer section is set to **OFF**, it can only randomly become one one of the two.
    4. A length class also determines the catalyzers specificity (the number of explicit characters in a reaction class, for example R-A + BA-R -> 3, R-ABBAB-R -> 5). The extracted species can only become catalyzers for reaction class with higher or equal specificity.
- It then iterates the previous steps until convergence, when no new species have been generated. It is also important to remember that only the species that respect the ML filter in system section in input file, can partake in new reactions (all described in system section in input example).

At the end of the script execution, `parsed_data` takes the following structure:
```py
{
'species':  [[<nomespecie>, <concentrazione>, <contributo>]],
'catalyzer_params': [[<range>], <n_cond_catalyzers>, <n_cll_catalyzers>, <both_on>],  
'reactions': {'conds': [<specie>], 'clls': [<specie>] },
'catalyzers': {'cond': [<specie>], 'cll': [<specie>] },
'cond_reactions': [<reactant_1>, <reactant_2>, <v>, [<catalyzers>]]
'cll_reactions': [<specie>, <cleavage_1>, <cleavage_2>, <v>, [<catalyzers>]]
